        <h1>Garlic Toast Recipe</h1>
          <p>A staple in my household with Lasagna is Garlic Toast.
            The crunch from the toast is perfect alongside your Italian compatriot.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>1 loaf of bread</li>
            <li>3 cloves crushed garlic</li>
            <li>5 tsp butter</li>
            <li>2 tsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp oregano</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. 
                Cut loaf into ten 1-inch slices.</li>
            <li>Mix butter, garlic, oil, oregano, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; 
                spread butter mixture on one side of each slice of bread; 
                arrange bread slices, butter-side up, in a single layer on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Cook under the preheated broiler until slightly brown, 
                checking frequently so they do not burn, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven and serve hot.</li>
          </ol>
