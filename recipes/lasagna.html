          <p>Originating from Italy, lasagna is a popular dish enjoyed around the world. 
            Despite being simple to make there are many different variations of the dish available. 
            This is my personal favourite and I can't wait to share it with you.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients (Serves 8)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>2lb ground beef</li>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 chopped onion</li>
            <li>3 cloves of minced garlic</li>
            <li>24 ounce jar of Marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1 tsp oregano</li>
            <li>1 tsp parsley</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cup cottage cheese</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 9 x 13 inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Combine the ground beef and onion in a large, deep sauce pan.
                 Cook over medium high heat, breaking apart the meat with a spatula, until no pink remains.
                  Drain any excess fat off the pan, then stir in garlic, pasta sauce, oregano and half of the salt and pepper.
                  Heat through then reduce heat to low. Allow the sauce to simmer while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add a fat pinch of salt and swirl of oil (this helps keep the noodles from sticking.) 
                Add the noodles to the pot and cook for about 2 minutes less than the package directions. 
                Drain noodles then lay them out on aluminum foil so they'll be ready to go later.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, stir together the cottage cheese, egg, Parmesan cheese, parsley and remaining salt and pepper. Set aside.</li>
          </ol>
